**DecodeDeps** is a dev-tool that analyzes and visualizes module dependencies in js, jsx, ts, tsx projects. It identifies modules using `import` and `require` statements and generates a graph to illustrate these relationships. By providing a visualization of module dependencies, it offers insights for building a more structured codebase.

## 🚀 Last Update v.1.2.0 (November 13, 2024)

- Add functionality to distinguish and display **external** and **internal** modules
- Update UI for the side menu

## 🌟 Key Features

- **For js, jsx, ts and tsx files**: Visualizes module dependencies by analyzing `import` and `require` statements, providing a graph view.
- **Multiple folders**: Make it easy to analyze entire projects or specific subfolders.
- **Detect circular dependencies**: Automatically identifies circular dependencies within your modules.
- **Various Node Color**: Node colors vary based on module size, offering a quick visual indication.
- **Interactive Graph**: Navigate and explore the dependency graph with zoom and pan features, as well as adjustable node sizes and link distances, providing a fully interactive visualization

## 📥 Installation

```bash
npm install decode-deps
```

or

```bash
yarn add decode-deps
```

## 💡 How to use

**Step 1.** Install `decode-deps`.

**Step 2.** Run the command, `npx decode-deps` with input array. You can put folder names that you want to scan. For example, to analyze files within the `./src` folder, use:

```bash
npx decode-deps '["./src"]'
```

To explore multiple folders, specify them as follows:

```bash
npx decode-deps '["./src", "./dist"]'
```

**Step 3.** After running the command, you can see the results at `localhost:5001`.

## 🔍 Who Should Use This Library?

- **Refactoring Teams.** Easily identify optimization points during routine refactoring.
